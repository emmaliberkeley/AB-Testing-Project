    "Evaluation metrics are used to test the performance of what we care about. It could be high level business metrics or detail metrics on user experience research. Evaluation metrics should have a good balance between sensitivity and robustness, meaning being sensitive enough that they pick up the changes we care about and being robust against the changes we do not care about.\n",

    "\n",
    "How many metrics do we need? For sanity checking, we need multiple metrics. For evaluation, some companies want just one metric so that different teams are working toward one goal collectively. If we have mutiple evaluation metrics, we can test each one of them, though might need adjust the alpha.  More on this in section [5. Multiple Metrics Alpha Correction?](#5-multiple-metrics-alpha-correction)). We can also create a composite metric: Objective Function or OEC(overall evaluation criterion) which is a weighed metrics of all individual metrics. OEC is not advised because need to define all of the individual metrics and may lead to confusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, we cannot implement every change that's statistically significant because of the cost of implementation or may want to wait for more substantial change. In addition to assessing statistical significance, we also consider the practical significance, denoted as 'dmin.' \n",

    "#### 7. Interpretation & Recommendation\n",
    "The original question is about \"How to reduce early cancellations?\" In anther word, the goal it to increase the number of students sticking to the end of the course, which translate to better student (user) experience without sacraficing the revenue (total numebr of payments). In fact, the user experience and revenue can increase at the same time through one strategy: increasing the coaching capacity. By investing in more coaching resources, students will have sufficent coaching support to help them stay longer at each course, which increases the number of payments. At the same time, with more support and better user experience, Udacity can build up a positive brand image and the word-of-mouth effect will attract more students to enroll and convert to payment users. That will be a win, win, win situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback of the \"Free Trial Screener\" treatment is that it will discourage low commitment students from becoming a paied user. Those students may not have immediate commitment but they still hope that after they invest in the course, they will be more motivated to take the course. This is similar to the gym memebership situation where people like to buy gym membership especially during New Year to motivate them to keep working out. Essentially, there are two types of students. One type is they need to get the course certificate, so they pay and finish the course. The other type is they need a motivation to study, so they first made the payment and then figure out a way to continue study, though they might not be as likely to finish the course as the first type. Thus, we do not want to miss out revenue from the second cohort. "
