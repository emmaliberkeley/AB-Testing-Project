# AB Testing Ethics and Policies
1. Risk: what risk is the participant undertaking? The main threshold is whether the risk exceeds that of “minimal risk”.
2. Beneift: what benefits might result from the study? Even if the risk is minimal, how might the results help?
3. Choice: what other choices do participants have? For example, if you are testing out changes to a search engine, participants always have the choice to use another search engine. In online experiments, the issues to consider are what the other alternative services that a user might have, and what the switching costs might be, in terms of time, money, information, etc.
4. Privacy: what data is being collected, and what is the expectation of privacy and confidentiality? 
    1. How sensitive is the data?
    2. What is the re-identification risk of individuals from the data?
    3. Timestamp, other than SSN or DL or credit card info, is also a sensitive data 
5. Questions to be asked about the data
    1. Are users being informed?
    2. What user identifiers are tied to the data?
    3. What types of data are being collected?
    4. What is the level of confidentiality or security?
6. Summary: Summary: it is a grey area as to whether many of these Internet studies should be subject to IRB review or not and whether informed consent is required. Neither has been common to date.
Most studies, due to the nature of the online service, are likely minimal risk, and the bigger question is about data collection with regards to identifiability, privacy, and confidentiality / security. That said, arguably, a neutral third party outside of the company should be making these calls rather than someone with a vested interest in the outcome. One growing risk in online studies is that of bias and the potential for discrimination, such as differential pricing and whether that is discriminatory to a particular population for example.
